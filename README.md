# MeterScanPro (Application case-study)

# Project Overview

## Problem Statement
Shershah Water Supplier faces challenges in their water plant management. With over 30 water lines and 500+ customers, maintaining accurate readings is vital. The primary issue is "water theft," arising from unauthorized tampering, employee errors, and meter malfunctions. Current manual data entry is cumbersome.

## Requirements
Our goal is to develop an app for Shershah Water Supplier, enabling accurate readings, real-time detection of water theft, and improved data management with secure server transmission.

## Solution
We propose a real-time image-based AI application, utilizing Flutter for mobile development and Sqflite for offline data storage. Laravel API integration addresses water theft.

## Features
- Image Recognition: Ensures accurate meter readings.
- Offline Data Storage: Enables work without an internet connection.
- Real-Time Updates: Guarantees data accuracy and prevents theft.
- User-Friendly Interface: Ensures ease of use.
- Data Integrity: Prevents unauthorized tampering.
- Error Handling: Addresses issues promptly.
- Outsourced API Development: Cost-effective Laravel API implementation.

## Project Duration
The project is expected to be completed in one month, emphasizing efficiency and rapid deployment.
